My name is wayan. i have new cars from india. The colors are red and blue. I got those cars one week ago. my father gave those for my birthday gift.
I was very happy at that time. I thought it was for my neighbor, because we have the same birthday. I can not explain in words how happy i was.
I just want to thank to God because I have given a chance to live until now, I also want to thank to God for giving me such a happy and fun family like this.
